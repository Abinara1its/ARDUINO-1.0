The materials that have been taught are Introduction to C Language, Basic Data Types, Branching, Looping, Arrays, to Strings. In this repo there is a source code for the answer key, from the quiz practice questions, on the hackerrank platform which can be accessed via the following link (www.hackerrank.com/arduino-1). We also include a tutorial on installing Dev C++ software to be able to run the C language on your device. And there is a learning module that can be used as a reference for learning materials for you. Keep the spirit up and thank you.
