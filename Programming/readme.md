<h2 align="center">PROGRAMMING</h2>

The materials taught are Introduction to C Language, Basic Data Types, Branching, Looping, Arrays, to Strings. In this repo there is a source code for the answer key to the quiz practice questions on the hackerrank platform which can be accessed via the following link (www.hackerrank.com/arduino-1). We also include a tutorial on how to install Dev C++ software so that you can run the C language on your device. And there is a learning module that can be used as a reference for learning materials for you. We also include a video record link for Arduino 1.0 day-1 programming section, so you can repeat the learning, especially for those who were not present on the learning day. Stay enthusiastic and thank you.
